    <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three <i>fundamental</i> technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</p>
    <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>

    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>

    <p>HTML stands for <b>H</b>yperText <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).</p>
    <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>

    <h3>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>The opening tag</li>
      <li>The closing tag</li>
      <li>The actual element</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can learn more at the <a href="#">MDN Web Docs.</a></p>

    <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>

    <p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
      <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
      <li>To build web applications</li>
      <li>To impress friends</li>
      <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
